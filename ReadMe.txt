#Track App – Mobile Student & Teacher Management System

## Overview

Track App is a mobile application built using **React Native (Expo)** and **Node.js**, designed to manage Students and Teachers under an Admin role. Admins can create accounts, and Students/Teachers can log in using those credentials. The system uses **ngrok** for API tunneling and **MongoDB** as the backend database.

## Local Development Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Backend

```bash
cd track-server

```

The backend runs at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 3️⃣ Start ngrok (API tunneling)

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL generated by ngrok — use it in the frontend configuration if needed.

### 4️⃣ Start the Frontend (Expo)

```bash
cd track
npm install
npm start
```

Expo DevTools will open in your browser.

### 5️⃣ Install Expo Go App

Download the app from:

* Google Play Store (Android)
* Apple App Store (iOS)

### 6️⃣ Run the App

* Scan the QR code from Expo DevTools or terminal
